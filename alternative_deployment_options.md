## Important Considerations for All Platforms

1. **API Key Security**: Always use environment variables for your OpenAI API key.
2. **System Dependencies**: Ensure the platform supports installing system dependencies like poppler-utils.
3. **Storage**: Consider how to handle file storage for PDFs and generated content.
4. **Costs**: Monitor usage to avoid unexpected charges, especially with OpenAI API calls.
5. **Performance**: Start with a basic tier and scale up as needed.
