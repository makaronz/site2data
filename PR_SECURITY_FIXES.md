# Security Fixes for ai_CineHub

## Summary of Changes

This pull request addresses 46 high-severity security vulnerabilities identified by CodeQL in the ai_CineHub codebase. The vulnerabilities fall into two main categories:

1. **Path Traversal Vulnerabilities (25 issues)**
   - Implemented a comprehensive path sanitization utility to prevent unauthorized file access
   - Added validation for all file paths throughout the application
   - Restricted file operations to designated safe directories

2. **Missing Rate Limiting (21 issues)**
   - Implemented tiered rate limiting middleware for all API endpoints
   - Added specific protection for authentication and resource-intensive operations
   - Included proper headers and response formatting for rate-limited requests

## Implementation Details

### Path Sanitization

- Created a new `pathSanitizer` utility with comprehensive security checks:
  - Path traversal detection and prevention
  - Directory whitelist validation
  - Safe file operation wrappers
  - File extension validation

### Rate Limiting

- Implemented a flexible rate limiting system with three tiers:
  - Standard API endpoints: 100 requests per 15 minutes
  - Authentication endpoints: 10 requests per 15 minutes
  - Resource-intensive operations: 20 requests per hour
- Added custom rate limiter factory for specialized endpoints

### Testing

- Added comprehensive test suite for both security features
- Achieved good test coverage for critical security components
- Ensured all security fixes are properly validated

## Security Impact

These changes significantly improve the application's security posture by:

1. Preventing unauthorized access to sensitive files through path traversal attacks
2. Protecting against denial-of-service attacks through API abuse
3. Adding proper validation and sanitization throughout the codebase

## Next Steps

- Consider implementing additional security headers
- Add CSRF protection for sensitive operations
- Implement more granular user-based rate limiting
