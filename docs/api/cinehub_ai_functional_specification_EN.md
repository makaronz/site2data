## 5. Data Model (High-Level)
*   **Main Entities:** `Project`, `User`, `Member`, `Role`, `Permission`, `Asset` (File/Folder), `Version`, `Tag`, `Comment`, `Task`, `AIAnalysisResult`, `Notification`.
*   **Key Relationships:**
    *   Project contains Members, Assets, Tasks, Tags, Roles.
    *   User can be a Member of multiple Projects, create Assets, Tasks, Comments.
    *   Member links User and Project, has an assigned Role.
    *   Role defines Permissions.
    *   Asset (Folder) contains other Assets.
    *   Asset (File) has Versions, Tags, Comments, AIAnalysisResults, can be linked to Tasks.
    *   Comment can be a reply to another Comment.
    *   Task has Assignees (Users), can have Subtasks, and be linked to Assets.
*   *(Detailed relational/document model to be developed during the technical design phase)*.

## 6. System Architecture (High-Level)
*   **Paradigm:** Modular Monolith (preferred initially) or Service-Oriented approach, with a clearly separated AI module.
*   **Main Components:** Frontend (Web App), Backend (API & Logic), AI Module (Processing Engine), Primary Database, Vector Database, File Storage, Task Queue.
*   **Proposed Tech Stack:**
    *   Frontend: React/Vue/Svelte + visualization libs (D3.js/Vis.js/Cytoscape.js).
    *   Backend: Python + FastAPI/Django.
    *   AI: Python + LangChain + Hugging Face Transformers + OpenCV + Whisper etc.
    *   Primary DB: PostgreSQL (+ pgvector?) / MongoDB.
    *   Vector DB: Weaviate/Pinecone/Chroma/Milvus.
    *   File Storage: AWS S3 / Google Cloud Storage / Azure Blob Storage.
    *   Task Queue: Celery + Redis/RabbitMQ.
*   **AI Integration:** LangChain as orchestrator; hybrid hosting strategy for HF models (smaller ones locally, larger/multimodal ones on Inference Endpoints - potentially private).
*   **Infrastructure:** Containerization (Docker), deployment on public cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure) or on-premise, monitoring, logging.
