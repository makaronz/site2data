  - Events grouped by shooting day
  - Custom event rendering with scene details
  - Tooltips with cast, props, and page count
  - Click handler to open context panel
  - CSV export functionality
- **Visual Enhancements**: Color coding for interior/exterior scenes

### 4. Narrative Playback Mode

- **Timeline Navigation**: Implemented scene-by-scene exploration
- **API Integration**: 
  - Connected to `GET /api/scenes` for all scenes
  - Connected to `GET /api/graph/scene/:id` for per-scene character graphs
- **Playback Controls**:
  - Previous/Next navigation
  - Play/Pause with automatic progression
  - Keyboard shortcuts (Space, ←, →)
- **Dynamic Graph Updates**: Real-time graph transitions between scenes
- **Scene Details Panel**: Contextual information about the current scene

### 5. Props Matrix Implementation

- **Cross-Reference Matrix**: Scene × Prop visualization
- **API Integration**:
  - Connected to `GET /api/scenes`
  - Connected to `GET /api/props`
- **Interactive Features**:
  - Filter by prop type
  - "Show Missing Only" toggle
  - Sorting by scene number, location, or prop count
  - Interactive checkboxes for allocation
- **Summary View**: Aggregated statistics for each prop

### 6. Performance Optimizations

- **React.memo()**: Applied to heavy components
- **Debounced Filters**: Implemented for search inputs
- **Memoized Calculations**: Used useMemo for expensive operations
- **Callback Optimization**: Used useCallback for event handlers
- **Conditional Rendering**: Optimized for large datasets

## Technical Implementation

### API Integration

All views now connect to backend APIs:
- Character Map: `GET /api/graph/characters`
- Scene Breakdown: `GET /api/scenes`
- Shooting Planner: `GET /api/schedule`
- Narrative Playback: `GET /api/scenes` and `GET /api/graph/scene/:id`
- Props Matrix: `GET /api/scenes` and `GET /api/props`

### State Management

- **Zustand Store**: Enhanced with additional selectors and actions
- **API State Handling**: Loading, error, and success states for all API calls
- **Filter State**: Implemented for all filterable views

### Testing

Comprehensive test coverage for all new features:
- **CharacterMap.test.tsx**: Tests graph rendering, filters, exports
- **SceneBreakdown.test.tsx**: Tests mood graph loading and filters
- **NarrativePlayback.test.tsx**: Tests scene progression and keyboard navigation
- **ShootingPlanner.test.tsx**: Tests calendar rendering and event tooltips
- **PropsMatrix.test.tsx**: Tests matrix rendering and interactivity

All tests include:
- API integration with mock responses
- Zustand state updates
- Keyboard/mouse interactions
- Error handling

## Screenshots

[Screenshots will be added upon PR submission]

## Next Steps

1. **User Testing**: Gather feedback on the new interactive features
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor performance with large datasets
3. **Accessibility Improvements**: Enhance keyboard navigation and screen reader support
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Further improve responsive design for small screens

## Conclusion

This PR completes the transformation of ai_CineHub from a static UI to a fully dynamic, data-driven application. All views are now connected to backend APIs, with rich visualizations and interactive features that enhance the user experience.
