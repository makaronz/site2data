# Site2Data Deployment Summary

This document provides an overview of all the deployment options and files created to help you deploy the Site2Data application.

## Deployment Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Procfile` | Specifies how to run the application on platforms like Render and Heroku |
| `requirements.txt` | Lists all Python dependencies including gunicorn for web serving |
| `install_dependencies.sh` | Script to install system dependencies (poppler-utils for pdftotext) |
| `Dockerfile` | Instructions for building a Docker container for the application |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Configuration for running the application with Docker Compose |
| `deploy.sh` | Helper script for committing and pushing changes to GitHub |
| `docker_test.sh` | Helper script for testing Docker deployment locally |

## Deployment Guides

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `deployment_guide.md` | Primary guide for deploying to Render |
| `alternative_deployment_options.md` | Instructions for other platforms (PythonAnywhere, Heroku, Google Cloud Run, AWS, DigitalOcean) |
| `docker_deployment_guide.md` | Guide for deploying with Docker locally and to container platforms |

## Deployment Options Summary

### 1. Render (Primary Option)
- Free tier available
- Easy deployment from GitHub
- Supports Python applications
- See `deployment_guide.md` for detailed instructions

### 2. Docker Deployment
- Run locally or on any platform that supports Docker
- Consistent environment across different systems
- Good for development and testing
- See `docker_deployment_guide.md` for instructions

### 3. Alternative Cloud Platforms
- **PythonAnywhere**: Python-specific hosting with free tier
- **Heroku**: Popular PaaS with good Python support
- **Google Cloud Run**: Serverless container platform
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Amazon's PaaS offering
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Simple deployment with reasonable pricing
- See `alternative_deployment_options.md` for details on each

## Quick Start

### For Render Deployment:
1. Commit and push your changes: `./deploy.sh`
2. Follow the instructions in `deployment_guide.md`

### For Docker Deployment:
1. Use the helper script: `./docker_test.sh` (recommended)
   OR
   Build and run manually: `docker-compose up --build`
2. Access the application at http://localhost:5000

## Important Considerations

1. **API Key Security**: Always use environment variables for your OpenAI API key
2. **System Dependencies**: Ensure the platform supports installing poppler-utils
3. **Storage**: Consider how to handle file storage for PDFs and generated content
4. **Costs**: Monitor usage to avoid unexpected charges, especially with OpenAI API calls

## Next Steps

1. Choose the deployment option that best fits your needs
2. Follow the corresponding deployment guide
3. Test your deployed application
4. Monitor performance and costs
