# Memory Bank: Site2Data Repository Audit and Repair

## What Broke and Why

### 1. WebSocket Type Mismatch
**What Broke**: WebSocket communication between frontend and backend was failing due to inconsistent type definitions.
**Why**: The frontend and backend had separate, incompatible type definitions for WebSocket messages. When the backend sent messages, the frontend couldn't properly type-check or process them.
**Root Cause**: Lack of a shared type system between frontend and backend in a monorepo structure.

### 2. Missing WebSocket Connection Component
**What Broke**: WebSocket connections were unreliable, with potential memory leaks and reconnection issues.
**Why**: The application lacked a dedicated WebSocket connection management component, leading to scattered connection logic.
**Root Cause**: Incomplete implementation of the WebSocket architecture, with focus on message handling but not connection lifecycle.

### 3. Incomplete WebSocket Implementation
**What Broke**: WebSocket server had placeholder logic that didn't properly integrate with the actual services.
**Why**: The WebSocket server was implemented with temporary mock data rather than connecting to real services.
**Root Cause**: Possibly an incremental development approach where the WebSocket infrastructure was set up before the services were ready.

### 4. Missing WebSocket Authentication
**What Broke**: WebSocket connections were insecure, allowing unauthorized access.
**Why**: No authentication mechanism was implemented for WebSocket connections.
**Root Cause**: Security considerations were likely postponed during initial development.

### 5. Version Mismatch in Dependencies
**What Broke**: Potential runtime errors and inconsistent behavior across packages.
**Why**: Different packages in the monorepo used different versions of the same dependencies.
**Root Cause**: Decentralized dependency management without version alignment enforcement.

### 6. Missing Error Boundaries
**What Broke**: Component errors could crash the entire application.
**Why**: No React error boundaries were implemented to contain failures.
**Root Cause**: Incomplete error handling strategy in the frontend architecture.

### 7. Inconsistent Error Handling
**What Broke**: Errors were handled differently across the codebase, leading to unpredictable error reporting.
**Why**: No standardized approach to error handling and reporting.
**Root Cause**: Lack of error handling guidelines or middleware in the initial architecture.

### 8. File Upload Validation Mismatch
**What Broke**: Files accepted by frontend might be rejected by backend, leading to confusing user experience.
**Why**: Frontend and backend had different validation rules for file uploads.
**Root Cause**: Validation logic duplicated rather than shared between frontend and backend.

### 9. Potential Memory Leaks in useEffect
**What Broke**: Components with subscriptions or timers could cause memory leaks.
**Why**: Missing cleanup functions in useEffect hooks.
**Root Cause**: Incomplete understanding or implementation of React's useEffect cleanup pattern.

### 10. Hardcoded Text in UI Components
**What Broke**: UI was not localizable and could cause hydration errors if server/client languages differed.
**Why**: Text was hardcoded in Polish without internationalization.
**Root Cause**: Internationalization was likely postponed or not considered in initial development.

### 11. Missing API Error Handling
**What Broke**: Generic error messages that didn't help users resolve issues.
**Why**: Incomplete error handling for API responses.
**Root Cause**: Focus on happy path implementation without comprehensive error handling.

### 12. Simulated Data Loading
**What Broke**: Disconnection between frontend and backend data flow.
**Why**: Using setTimeout to simulate API calls instead of actual API integration.
**Root Cause**: Frontend development proceeded independently of backend, using mock data.

### 13. Inconsistent State Management
**What Broke**: Difficult state synchronization and potential race conditions.
**Why**: Mix of local state, Zustand, and potentially React Query without clear boundaries.
**Root Cause**: Lack of state management guidelines in the architecture.

## Pattern Updates

### 1. Monorepo Type Sharing
**Pattern**: Create a dedicated shared types package in monorepos with frontend and backend.
**Implementation**: 
- Place shared types in `packages/shared-types`
- Export interfaces, enums, and validation schemas
- Import in both frontend and backend
- Include in build pipeline

### 2. WebSocket Connection Management
**Pattern**: Use a dedicated WebSocket hook and context for connection management.
**Implementation**:
- Create a custom hook with connection lifecycle management
- Implement reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- Provide connection status to components
- Handle authentication and message parsing

### 3. Error Boundary Strategy
**Pattern**: Implement strategic error boundaries at key component boundaries.
**Implementation**:
- Create a reusable ErrorBoundary component
- Place at route boundaries and around critical features
- Log errors to monitoring service
- Provide user-friendly fallback UI

### 4. Unified Error Handling
**Pattern**: Use middleware for API errors and a centralized service for other errors.
**Implementation**:
- Create error handling middleware for Express
- Implement centralized error reporting service
- Standardize error response format
- Include error codes and user-friendly messages

### 5. Shared Validation
**Pattern**: Share validation schemas between frontend and backend.
**Implementation**:
- Define validation schemas in shared package
- Use Zod for type-safe validation
- Apply validation in both frontend and backend
- Generate TypeScript types from validation schemas

### 6. React Hook Cleanup
**Pattern**: Always include cleanup functions in useEffect hooks with subscriptions.
**Implementation**:
- Return cleanup function from useEffect
- Cancel subscriptions and timers
- Remove event listeners
- Clear intervals and timeouts

### 7. State Management Boundaries
**Pattern**: Define clear boundaries for different state management approaches.
**Implementation**:
- Use local state for component-specific UI state
- Use Zustand for shared application state
- Use React Query for server state
- Document patterns in codebase

## What to Avoid in Future

1. **Duplicated Type Definitions**: Never define the same types separately in frontend and backend. Always use shared types.

2. **Missing WebSocket Lifecycle Management**: Always implement proper connection management, including reconnection logic and authentication.

3. **Inconsistent Dependency Versions**: Maintain consistent versions across packages in a monorepo to prevent compatibility issues.

4. **Incomplete Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling from the start, including boundaries, middleware, and user feedback.

5. **Hardcoded Text**: Use internationalization from the beginning, even if only one language is initially supported.

6. **Mock Data Without Clear Transition Path**: When using mock data during development, ensure a clear path to replace it with real API integration.

7. **Scattered State Management**: Define clear guidelines for when to use different state management approaches.

8. **Missing Effect Cleanup**: Always include cleanup functions in useEffect hooks that create subscriptions or timers.

9. **Separate Validation Logic**: Share validation logic between frontend and backend to ensure consistency.

10. **Ignoring Authentication in WebSockets**: Apply the same authentication standards to WebSockets as to REST APIs.

## Tools/Framework Interactions Observed

1. **React + WebSockets**: React's component lifecycle requires careful management of WebSocket connections to prevent memory leaks and ensure proper reconnection.

2. **Monorepo + TypeScript**: Monorepos need explicit type sharing strategies to maintain type safety across packages.

3. **Express + Error Handling**: Express benefits from centralized error handling middleware to standardize error responses.

4. **React + Error Boundaries**: React's error boundaries are essential for preventing entire application crashes due to component errors.

5. **Zustand + React Query**: These state management tools can coexist but need clear boundaries to prevent state duplication or conflicts.

6. **Vite + SSR**: Vite supports SSR but requires specific configuration that wasn't implemented in this project.

7. **WebSockets + Authentication**: WebSockets require explicit authentication handling, unlike REST APIs where it's often handled by middleware.

8. **React + Internationalization**: React components with hardcoded text can cause hydration errors in SSR contexts if languages differ.

9. **TypeScript + Validation**: TypeScript types and runtime validation need to be aligned to prevent type/runtime mismatches.

10. **Express + WebSockets**: Integrating WebSockets with Express requires careful server setup and proper error handling.

11. **React + useEffect**: React's useEffect hook requires cleanup functions to prevent memory leaks, especially with subscriptions.

12. **Monorepo + Dependencies**: Monorepos need careful dependency management to prevent version conflicts and ensure consistent behavior.
