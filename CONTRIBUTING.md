# Contributing to CineHubAI

We love your input! We want to make contributing to CineHubAI as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/your-username/cinehub-ai/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/your-username/cinehub-ai/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Development Process

We follow these coding standards:

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use ESLint with our provided configuration
- Follow Prettier formatting rules
- Write meaningful commit messages following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
- Document new code based on JSDoc standards

### Python

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where possible
- Document functions and classes using Google-style docstrings
- Use pytest for testing

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
2. Update the documentation with details of any new functionality
3. The PR may be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer
4. If you haven't been granted the ability to merge, your PR will be merged by a maintainer
