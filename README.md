# ai_CineHub

**ai_CineHub is an advanced, AI-powered platform designed for filmmakers and production teams to deeply analyze film scripts and streamline pre-production workflows. It leverages Large Language Models (OpenAI) to automatically extract, structure, and analyze vast amounts of data from screenplays (initially PDFs, with future support for other formats).**

The platform offers structured insights, dedicated analytical views tailored for various crew roles (e.g., producer, director, cinematographer, production designer), interactive character relationship graphs, and tools to support production planning, risk assessment, and resource management.

## Roadmap & Progress

The project is currently undergoing significant development to implement a comprehensive suite of features for film production analysis.

### Current Focus & Next Steps:

*   **UI Integration & Enhancement:**
    *   Consolidating and integrating different UI implementations (new main interface and `frontend/` directory) into a unified user experience.
    *   Implementing the 9 core analytical sections with improved UI/UX and data presentation.
*   **Phase 1: Extended Data Modeling & Backend Core (In Progress):**
    *   Defining detailed MongoDB schemas and TypeScript types for all new data structures (scenes, characters with centrality, relationships, production schedules, risk checklists, etc.).
    *   Defining Weaviate classes for `Scene`, `Character`, `Location` embeddings.
    *   Updating AI prompts and `analyzer.ts` (in `apps/api`) for extracting and processing extended data with Zod validation.
    *   Implementing backend API endpoints (CRUD) for data editing.
    *   Developing logic for graph metrics calculation (e.g., character centrality).
*   **Phase 2: Backend Logic for Views, Aggregations & Graph Serving (Upcoming):**
    *   Implementing MongoDB aggregations for cross-reference matrices and other specialized views.
    *   Developing algorithms for production day grouping.
    *   Creating APIs for dedicated views (Producer's Risk Checklist, Cinematographer's View, etc.).
    *   Implementing mood analysis logic (potentially using Weaviate similarity).
    *   Building APIs for data export (JSON, CSV, GEXF) and graph data serving (for Sigma.js).
*   **Phase 3: Frontend Implementation (Upcoming):**
    *   Developing React components for all new analytical views and data editing interfaces.
    *   Implementing the interactive character relationship graph (`RelationshipGraph.tsx` with `@react-sigma/core`), including styling, controls, overlays, and export.
    *   Implementing UI layout suggestions (e.g., production metadata header, sticky analysis menu).
*   **Phase 4: Comprehensive Testing, Optimization & Iteration (Upcoming):**
    *   Manual E2E testing, performance testing (especially for graphs).
    *   Code refactoring and optimization.

## Recent Bug Fixes (2025-01-31)

### ✅ Fixed Issues

1. **MUI Button Warning**: Fixed invalid `button` prop in `Sidebar.tsx` component
2. **React Router Future Flags**: Added v7 compatibility flags to eliminate warnings
3. **AxiosError for presigned upload URL**: Added proper error handling and mock endpoints

### 🔧 Current Backend Configuration

The project currently runs with a **simplified backend** (`backend/simple-server.js`) for development. For full functionality including file uploads, you need to run the complete API implementation.

#### Quick Start (Simple Backend)
```bash
npm start  # Uses backend/simple-server.js
```

#### Full API Implementation
```bash
# Switch to full API implementation in apps/api
cd apps/api
npm install
npm start

# Update frontend configuration to point to full API
# The full API runs on port 3001 and includes:
# - File upload with presigned URLs
# - MinIO integration
# - Redis for job queuing
# - MongoDB for job storage
```

### 🚨 Known Limitations with Simple Backend

- File upload functionality returns 501 Not Implemented
- No MinIO/Redis/MongoDB integration
- Limited to basic API key validation and health checks

### 🔄 Migration Path

To enable full functionality:

1. Set up required services (MinIO, Redis, MongoDB)
2. Configure environment variables for the full API
3. Switch from `backend/simple-server.js` to `apps/api`
4. Update `start.sh` to use the full API implementation

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
